**What is this?**
- This is a python script I use for managing autosave.dat files for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix on a Windows PC. It includes options for copying, loading, and deleting autosave data.

**Prerequisites:**
- 1fmSaveAnywhere.lua must be installed to use the autosaves.
- Python 3 must be installed.

**How do I use it?**
- Lines 14 & 15 need to be modified to fit your system.
- Lines 16 & 17 can be modified to your liking.
- When navigating menus, simply type the corresponding menu item number, and press Enter.
- The Save menu allows you to make a copy of the current autosave.dat.
- The Load menu allows you to replace the current autosave.dat with whichever you select. Doing so will also create a backup of the current autosave.dat, unless loading the backup itself.
- The Delete menu allows you to delete created saves.

**Note:**
- I'm by no means a professional. I use this script regularly, but please use it yourself at your own discretion. Backup your autosaves elsewhere.
